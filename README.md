# Notes on Mathematics and Cryptography

In this repository we have an introduction to mathematics and cryptography.
This is focused on teaching software engineers the necessary mathematics 
to understand Public-Key Cryptography;
specifically, the goal is to teach digital signatures
and Elliptic Curve Cryptography.
Additional material is included on Pairing-based Cryptography,
Zero-Knowledge Proofs, and Secret Sharing protocols.
We do discuss parts of Symmetric Key Cryptography (including hash functions),
but that is not the primary focus.

In `/examples`, we include Python3 scripts for most of the examples.
This allows individuals to modify the examples from the text
as they seek a deeper understanding of the mathematics and cryptography.

## Status

This document has been looked over multiple times,
but it is still in the development stage because it needs more field testing.
