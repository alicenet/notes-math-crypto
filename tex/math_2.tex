\label{chap:math_2}

We now build on our mathematical discussion from Chapter~\ref{chap:math_1}.
Here, we focus on the algebraic objects known as \glspl{group},
\glspl{ring}, and \glspl{field}.
These mathematical objects enable us to discuss the specifics
of \gls{publiccrypto}.

To assist in this discussion, we will first begin with intuition
and examples before giving the formal definition;
we include non-examples as well.

\section{Concluding Discussion}
It would be a valid question to ask if everything discussed here
is absolutely necessary to begin to understand cryptography.
The answer is \emph{yes} if one is really interested in getting
more than just a superficial view of \gls{publiccrypto}.
This is because \gls{publiccrypto} looks to work in \glspl{group}
where certain problems are deemed computationally infeasible.
We will discuss computational infeasibility more in Chapter~\ref{chap:hardness}.
