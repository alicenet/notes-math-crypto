\chapter{Mathematical Review: Elliptic Curves, Pairings, and Interpolation}
\chaptermark{Mathematical Review 3}
\label{chap:math_3}

In this chapter we continue on to more advanced mathematics.
Understanding the information here is not required before reading
other parts of the document.
Even so, the more advanced parts of this document will require some familiarity
with these topics.

\section{Important Information}

\begin{itemize}
\item \Gls{publiccrypto}, such as the \gls{dhke},
    requires \glspl{cyclic group}.
    Many \glspl{cyclic group} may be constructed from \glspl{elliptic curve}
    with greater flexibility than the other \glspl{group}
    discussed in Chapter~\ref{sec:math_groups}
    or Example~\ref{example:math_field_p_more}.
\item \Glspl{bilinear} allow for many interesting possibilities;
    in particular, they allow for \glspl{signature}
    like BLS signatures~\cite{BLSSignatures}.
    More generally, they allow for \Gls{pairingcrypto}
    as discussed in Chapter~\ref{chap:pairing}.
\item \Gls{lagrange interpolation} is used in the secret sharing protocols
    in Chapter~\ref{chap:secret_sharing}.
\end{itemize}

\section{Conclusion of Mathematical Review}

A lot of important and difficult material was covered
in the previous chapters.
There is still more mathematics that could be learned
and that would be useful for cryptography.
With that said, these are the main ideas and the most useful.
Studying additional mathematics would be recommended to anyone
who wants to dive deeper into cryptography;
see Chapter~\ref{chap:conclusion} for additional resources.
