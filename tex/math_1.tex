\chapter{Mathematical Review: Set Theory, Number Theory, and Complexity}
\chaptermark{Mathematical Review 1}
\label{chap:math_1}

In this chapter we begin our mathematical review.
Depending on one's background, it may be useful to skip these
chapters and return to them as needed.

While the information here and in the following chapters will continually
get more abstract, we make an effort to include numerous
\emph{concrete examples}.
Furthermore, we will attempt to point out \emph{why} we need
the various mathematical objects as they arise.
