\chapter{Additional Mathematics}
\label{app:math}

Here is material which was deemed not required for the
primary purpose of this text,
yet the author felt some individuals may find it useful.
It also will fill out some of the details which were glossed
over because they were not strictly necessary.

The mathematical level of the different topics will vary.
Even so, the goal is that this material will still be accessible
for more determined readers.
The material here should be considered a brief introduction.
A more thorough book on \gls{number theory} may be found
here~\cite{ComputationalIntroNTA}.
