Salsa20 has progressed to the third round of eSTREAM without any changes.

The reduced-round ciphers Salsa20/12 and Salsa20/8 are among the fastest 256-bit stream ciphers available and are recommended for applications where speed is more important than confidence. The fastest known attacks use ≈{\thinspace}2153 simple operations against Salsa20/7, ≈{\thinspace}2249 simple operations against Salsa20/8, and ≈{\thinspace}2255 simple operations against Salsa20/9, Salsa20/10, etc. In this paper, the Salsa20 designer presents Salsa20 and discusses the decisions made in the Salsa20 design.},

Poly1305-AES computes a 16-byte authenticator of a variable-length message, using a 16-byte AES key, a 16-byte additional key, and a 16-byte nonce. The security of Poly1305-AES is very close to the security of AES; the security gap is at most 14D⌈L/16⌉/2106 if messages have at most L bytes, the attacker sees at most 264 authenticated messages, and the attacker attempts D forgeries. Poly1305-AES can be computed at extremely high speed: for example, fewer than 3.1l{\thinspace}+{\thinspace}780 Athlon cycles for an ℓ-byte message. This speed is achieved without precomputation; consequently, 1000 keys can be handled simultaneously without cache misses. Special-purpose hardware can compute Poly1305-AES at even higher speed. Poly1305-AES is parallelizable, incremental, and not subject to any intellectual-property claims.},

    abstract={Previously known techniques to construct pairing-friendly curves of prime or near-prime order are restricted to embedding degree {\$}k {\backslash}leqslant 6 {\$}. More general methods produce curves over {\$}{\{}{\backslash}mathbb F{\}}{\_}{\{}p{\}}{\$}where the bit length of p is often twice as large as that of the order r of the subgroup with embedding degree k; the best published results achieve $\rho$ ≡ log(p)/log(r) {\textasciitilde} 5/4. In this paper we make the first step towards surpassing these limitations by describing a method to construct elliptic curves of prime order and embedding degree k = 12. The new curves lead to very efficient implementation: non-pairing operations need no more than {\$}{\{}{\backslash}mathbb F{\}}{\_}{\{}p^4{\}}{\$}arithmetic, and pairing values can be compressed to one third of their length in a way compatible with point reduction techniques. We also discuss the role of large CM discriminants D to minimize $\rho$; in particular, for embedding degree k = 2q where q is prime we show that the ability to handle log(D)/log(r) {\textasciitilde} (q--3)/(q--1) enables building curves with $\rho$ {\textasciitilde} q/(q--1).},

    abstract = {Security systems are built on strong cryptographic algorithms that foil pattern analysis attempts. However, the security of these systems is dependent on generating secret quantities for passwords, cryptographic keys, and similar quantities. The use of pseudo-random processes to generate secret quantities can result in pseudo-security. A sophisticated attacker may find it easier to reproduce the environment that produced the secret quantities and to search the resulting small set of possibilities than to locate the quantities in the whole of the potential number space. Choosing random quantities to foil a resourceful and motivated adversary is surprisingly difficult. This document points out many pitfalls in using poor entropy sources or traditional pseudo-random number generation techniques for generating such quantities. It recommends the use of truly random hardware techniques and shows that the existing hardware on many systems can be used for this purpose. It provides suggestions to ameliorate the problem when a hardware solution is not available, and it gives examples of how large such quantities need to be for some applications.

    abstract={For over two decades, timing attacks have been an active area of research within applied cryptography. These attacks exploit cryptosystem or protocol implementations that do not run in constant time. When implementing an elliptic curve cryptosystem with a goal to provide side-channel resistance, the scalar multiplication routine is a critical component. In such instances, one attractive method often suggested in the literature is Montgomery's ladder that performs a fixed sequence of curve and field operations. This paper describes a timing attack vulnerability in OpenSSL's ladder implementation for curves over binary fields. We use this vulnerability to steal the private key of a TLS server where the server authenticates with ECDSA signatures. Using the timing of the exchanged messages, the messages themselves, and the signatures, we mount a lattice attack that recovers the private key. Finally, we describe and implement an effective countermeasure.},
